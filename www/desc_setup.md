Experimental setup
===
 <br /> 
 
- One training and one test set are generated
randomly (each with 50%). Then the **parameter are tunned**, selecting the parameter values which provide the best accuracy on the test set

- Afterwards, a **4-fold cross validation** is developed using the whole available data

- "we are aware of that this methodology may lead to poor bias and variance... We used this methodology in order to keep low the computational cost of the experimental work"

 <br /> 
 
Evaluation measures
===
 <br /> 
 
- Average accuracy
- Friedman ranking (Sheskin, 2006) 
- Cohen Îº (Carletta, 1996)
