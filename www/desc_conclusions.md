Conclusions
===
<br />

This paper presents an exhaustive evaluation of **179 classifiers** belonging to a wide collection of **17 families** over the whole UCI machine learning classification database

<br />

The best results are achieved by the **parallel random forest (parRF t)**, implemented in R with caret, tuning the parameter mtry, arising to **average accuracy 82.0%** 

<br />

**Six RFs and five SVMs** are included among the 20 best classifiers, which are the
bests families

<br />

### The parRF t may be considered as a reference (“gold-standard”)
